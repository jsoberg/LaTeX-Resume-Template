# LaTeX Resume Template

A Resume template written in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\text{ \LaTeX }" /> (intended to be compiled in XeLaTeX, to PDF). This template was built with software engineering in mind, though it's hopefully generic enough to be customized for any experience.

Visually, the compiled resume is simple and clean:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsoberg/LaTeX-Resume-Template/main/readme-resources/resume-example-image.jpg" width=70%>
</p>

Additionally, as you'll see in the [Resume.tex](https://github.com/jsoberg/LaTeX-Resume-Template/blob/main/Resume.tex) template file, you can set various metadata (author, keywords, etc) that may help you pass automated resume submission checks that are looking for keywords specific to the job.


## Setup (Windows/MacOS/Linux)
1. Download and install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download)
1. Download and install [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
1. Set `TexMaker`'s `QuickBuild` to `XeLaTeX + View PDF`
1. Open `Resume.tex` in `TexMaker`: Running a `QuickBuild` will download necessary dependencies and output a PDF in the same directory.


## Other Notes
- I found [this Coursera course on resume writing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/how-to-write-a-resume) to be helpful as far as what/how to enter content into the resume itself.
- The [LaTeX fontawesome docs](https://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/fonts/fontawesome/doc/fontawesome.pdf) list all available fontawesome icons you can use.
- If you think something could be improved or iterated on, please add a post to the [Discussions forum](https://github.com/jsoberg/LaTeX-Resume-Template/discussions) or file an [issue](https://github.com/jsoberg/LaTeX-Resume-Template/issues)!
